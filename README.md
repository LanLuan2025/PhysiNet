# Advancing Interdisciplinary Physics through Deep Learning-Based Image Classification

## Overview
This project introduces a novel **deep learning-based image classification framework** tailored for interdisciplinary physics applications. By integrating **physics-informed modeling** with **state-of-the-art deep learning architectures**, this approach enhances the accuracy, scalability, and adaptability of traditional methods.

## Motivation
Interdisciplinary physics addresses complex scientific and engineering challenges that require knowledge from multiple domains. However, existing methods often rely on isolated physical models or domain-specific frameworks, limiting their **scalability** and **integration** across different scientific fields. Our proposed deep learning framework aims to overcome these limitations by **combining physics-based interpretability with data-driven predictive power**.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Image Classification**: Employs advanced neural networks to classify high-dimensional data from various domains.
- **Physics-Informed Modeling**: Enhances interpretability and robustness by integrating physical principles.
- **Multi-Domain Application**: Designed for use in biophysics, material science, environmental modeling, and other physics-driven fields.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Optimized for high-speed processing and scalability.

## Methodology
Our framework leverages:
1. **State-of-the-art Deep Learning Models** (e.g., CNNs, Transformers, or Hybrid Architectures).
2. **Physics-Guided Data Processing** to improve generalization and interpretability.
3. **Optimized Computational Pipelines** for handling large-scale interdisciplinary datasets.
